# CSE360_Project
Team Project for CSE360

This is our project that at the moment has user and admin users with multiple roles. The user can have roles such as student, instructor, reviewer, and staff. The admin will be able to manage the users by giving them roles, resetting their passwords, and being able to remove them. Users with the student role will be able to perform CRUD methods of questions and answers on the interface. The user will be saved under the database for reviewers and instructors to review their questions and post answers.

We also have input validation on our username and password fields.
Username - no spaces allowed, must be unique username
Password - no spaces allowed, special character needed, capital needed, and length greater than or equal to 6 characters
