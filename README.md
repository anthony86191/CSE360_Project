# CSE360_Project
Team Project for CSE360

This is our project that at the moment has user and admin users with multiple roles. The user can have roles such as student, instructor, reviewer and staff. The admin will be able to manage the users by giving them roles, resetting their passwords, and being able to remove them.

We also have input validation on our username and password fields.
Username - no spaces allowed, must be unique username
Password - no spaces allowed, special character needed, capital needed, and length greater than or equal to 6 characters
